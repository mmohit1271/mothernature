    <h2>Greed – The New Religion</h2>
    <p>
      Dear Homo Sapiens,<br><br>

      Congratulations. You've built temples of concrete, pipelines of profit, and forests of currency.  
      The rivers? Drained. The mountains? Mined. The forests? Flattened. But hey — you’ve got skyscrapers, right?  
      After all, nothing says “progress” like choking your own air and bottling your own water. 🏦🌫️<br><br>

      I watched you trade thousand-year-old trees for luxury resorts.  
      You poisoned lakes for mining gold you'll bury in a locker.  
      You even put a price tag on oxygen — bold move, really.  
      And while I bled rivers, you printed pamphlets. “Sustainable Growth.” Oh, the irony. 🙃<br><br>

      But here's the kicker: **I don’t need you.**  
      I can recover in silence after your extinction, like I did with the dinosaurs.  
      It’s not personal. Just ecological justice.<br><br>

      <strong>How to Avoid It?</strong><br>
      — Value trees more than trophies.  
      — Choose a reusable bag over an investment ad.  
      — Respect rivers like you do your bank account.  
      — Grow food, not followers.  
      — Teach kids to hug trees, not just chase targets.<br><br>

      Fix yourselves — or I’ll do it my way. And trust me, I don’t do refunds.<br><br>

      Yours till your last breath (literally),<br>
      <strong>Mother Nature 💸🌳</strong>
