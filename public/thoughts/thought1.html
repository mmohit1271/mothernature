  <h2>Mother Nature’s Sarcastic Note</h2>
  <p>
    Dear Humans,<br><br>

    Wow. You’ve really outdone yourselves this time.  
    I gave you crystal-clear rivers — you dyed them like tie-dye shirts with industrial waste.  
    I handed you fertile soil — and you paved it with parking lots.  
    My seasons had rhythm, balance, beauty — now they’re just confused.<br><br>

    Honestly, I used to be flattered by how much you depended on me. But now? Now it’s like I’m your emotional support system with zero support in return.  
    You drill into my core, suck out my oil, burn my forests, and then complain about the heat. Cute.<br><br>

    No worries though. I’ve been around for billions of years. I’ll survive.  
    Can’t say the same for you if your grand plan involves more plastic and less photosynthesis.  
    But go ahead — build another mall. I’ll send a gentle reminder. Maybe in the form of a hurricane. 🌪️<br><br>

    Warm regards (and warming fast),<br>
    <strong>Mother Nature 🌍</strong>
