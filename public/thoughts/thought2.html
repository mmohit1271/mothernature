  <h2>Climate Change? Never Heard of It.</h2>
  <p>
    Oh please, climate change? What a “trendy” buzzword. 🙄  
    I mean, who doesn’t love surprise weather?  
    45°C summers, flash floods in deserts, snow in April — just spicing things up for you!<br><br>

    But you keep doing you.  
    Fly solo in your 2-ton SUV to grab coffee.  
    Host another “bonfire party” with disposable plates and plastic cutlery.  
    Cut down a forest to build eco-resorts. The irony? Impeccable.  
    And when the sea level rises? Just build higher sea-facing villas. 😎<br><br>

    Don't worry about polar bears or melting glaciers — they never had Instagram anyway.  
    But hey, at least your AC is working… for now.  
    Can’t wait for you to invent a "Smart Planet" app after this one breaks down.<br><br>

    Sizzling sincerely,<br>
    <strong>Mother Nature 🔥❄️</strong>
